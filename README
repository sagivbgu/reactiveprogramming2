1.  whatsapp_manager:
    This is the managing server.
    The managing server includes 2 actors: ManagerActor & GroupActor.

    ~ ManagerActor does the following:
        * Managing the users:
            - Handles new user connections & disconnections:
                - Receives from the client ConnectRequest & DisconnectRequest messages
                  and answers ConnectionAccepted / ConnectionDenied & DisconnectAccepted
                  If the user tries to connect with a username that's already exists, the server
                  replies with ConnectionDenied, otherwise replies with ConnectionAccepted.

        * Managing the groups:
            - Handles creation on new groups:
                - When the user tries to create a new group, it sends CreateGroupRequest.
                  If there's not already a group with the same name, the ManagerActor creates a new GroupActor and
                  watches (Akka's DeathWatch) for the new group actor.
                  When the group actor stops itself (further info in GroupActor explanation) the ManagerActor
                  removes it from the active groups list.

            - Forwards relevant messages to a specific group:
                - All the group's commands are sent to the ManagerActor.
                  The ManagerActor just forwards these messages to the relevant GroupActor.

    ~ GroupActor does the following:
        - Handles all group related commands (except for group creation).
        - When the group creator leaves the group (or if exited from the client without /user disconnect)
          the group stops itself. The ManagerActor then gets notified the group stopped and removes it from the
          active groups list.


2. whatsapp_client:
    This is the client.
    The client includes the UserActor and CommandsExecutor.

    ~ CommandExecutor:
        * The CommandsExecutor reads and parses the input from the user, builds the relevant message
          and sends it to the UserActor.

    ~ UserActor:
        The UserActor has 4 states (become model):
        * disconnectedState:
            - In this state the only permitted messages are ConnectRequest / DisconnectAccepted.
              "Please connect before entering commands!" will be printed if any other message
              will be sent to the UserActor.

            - When ConnectRequest is received, we switch the state to the connecting state.

        * connectingState:
            - In this state the only permitted messages are ConnectionAccepted / ConnectionDenied.
              "Please wait until connection succeeds before entering commands!" will be printed if
              any other message will be sent to the UserActor.

            - When ConnectionAccepted is received, we switch the state to the connected state.

            - When ConnectionDenied is received, we switch back to the disconnecting state.

        * connectedState:
            - This state handles receiving all other commands the client must support (except for group invite command).
              When the UserActor receives message from the CommandsExecutor, it sends the message to the ManagerActor.

            - The UserActor watches (AKKA DeathWatch) for the ManagerActor.
              When the ManagerActor gets offline the UserActor prints "server got offline! disconnected."
              and switches to the disconnected state.

            - When GroupInviteMessage is received, we switch the state to the invited state.

        * invitedState:
            - This state is switched to when the user got an invitation to a group from other user
              and handles the invite process.

            - Notice that multiple invites at once is supported.
